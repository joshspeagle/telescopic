## Unreleased

### Added

- Per-replicate random streams keyed by the root seed, a namespace and the replicate
  index, buffered for lockstep batches (`telescopic._random`).
- Warning classes `TelescopicWarning`, `ConvergenceWarning` and `InputWarning`.
- Coupling primitives: the reflection-maximal coupling of Gaussians, the rejection maximal
  coupling with the bounded-variance `eta` option, and the maximal coupling of discrete
  distributions (`telescopic.couplings`); `telescopic.testing.fixed_draws` to inject
  random numbers in tests.
- `Target` with a batched interface over scalar or vectorised log-densities and gradients;
  initial distributions `Normal`, `Uniform`, `Empirical` and `as_initial`.
- Kernels with their couplings: `RandomWalk` (reflection-maximal or maximal proposals),
  `Independence` with a `MultivariateT` proposal, and `Mixture`.
